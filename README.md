Set up the environment: Ensure all necessary packages and dependencies are installed.
Run each script in the appropriate context.
Since the provided code relies on streamlit, supabase, and openai, make sure these libraries are installed in your environment. If not, you can install them using the following commands:

pip install streamlit supabase openai pymupdf pytesseract opencv-python

Here is a step-by-step plan for running the scripts:

Running backend.py: This script includes functions for interacting with a Supabase database. It doesn't execute any code when run directly, so we don't need to run this standalone.

Running ML.py: This script defines functions for extracting text from images and PDFs, as well as extracting health information using OpenAI's API. Like backend.py, it doesn't execute any code when run directly.

Running home.py: This script defines the main interface for interacting with the application via Streamlit. It relies on functions from ML.py.

Running signup_login.py: This is the main script that launches the Streamlit application. It incorporates functionality from both home.py and backend.py.

The main script to run is signup_login.py as it brings together all other scripts and initiates the Streamlit application.

Running the Streamlit Application

To run the Streamlit application, use the following command in your terminal:

streamlit run signup_login.py

Ensure that all the .py files (home.py, backend.py, ML.py, and signup_login.py) are in the same directory. This command will start the Streamlit application, which you can then interact with through your web browser.
